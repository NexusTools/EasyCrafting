##Easy Crafting fixed for Minecraft 1.4.7

Easy Crafting is a Minecraft mod that provides similar functionality to the now out of date mods like Crafting Table II (by ljdp) and Crafting Table III (by Zeldo). Essentially it's recursive crafting.

We forked this mod in order for it to properly work with our current modded Minecraft server, these issues are fixed in later commits by the original author, but crashes the 1.4.7 server.
